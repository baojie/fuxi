## General Help ##

Included is a harness for the OWL test cases (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-test/).  To run it, you will need to
download the archive of the approved tests (http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/approved.zip) into this directory and unzip it.

You will then be able to run the tests from the parent directory (/Fuxi/test):

python testOWL.py

This will scan each subdirectory under 'OWL' for a manifest files to use to setup and run each test.  Certain tests 
are skipped (listed below) for various reasons:

    'OWL/oneOf/Manifest003.rdf', #logical set equivalence?  Probably needs a built-in to support
    'OWL/differentFrom/Manifest002.rdf'  ,#needs log:notEqualTo
    'OWL/distinctMembers/Manifest001.rdf',#needs log:notEqualTo
    'OWL/intersectionOf/Manifest001.rdf' ,#can't calculate identical class extensions
    'OWL/unionOf/Manifest002.rdf',#can't implement set theoretic union for owl:unionOf.
    'OWL/InverseFunctionalProperty/Manifest001.rdf',#owl:sameIndividualAs deprecated
    'OWL/FunctionalProperty/Manifest001.rdf', #owl:sameIndividualAs deprecated
    'OWL/FunctionalProperty/Manifest002.rdf',#problems with owl:FunctionalProperty rule and right activating join nodes
    'OWL/Nothing/Manifest002.rdf',# owl:sameClassAs deprecated
    'OWL/AllDifferent/Manifest001.rdf',#requires support for built-ins (log:notEqualTo)

The OWL test harness uses the pD-rules.n3 ruleset, which is mostly  derived from "Completeness, decidability and 
complexity of entailment for RDF Schema and a semantic extension involving the OWL vocabulary" [1] and extended via 
owl-rules.n3 [2] and rdfs-rules.n3 [3] (mostly to cover the OWL test cases that weren't addressed by pD entailment).
